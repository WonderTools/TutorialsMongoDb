## Day1

### Importing Databases

JSON files for databases can be found in the **TutorialsMongoDB** repo

* **100YWeatherSmall.json**
  * Command to import the database --> **mongoimport --db 100YWeatherSmall --collection data --file 100YWeatherSmall.json** 
* **Video.json**
  * Command to import the database --> **mongoimport --db Video --collection movies --file Video.json**
* **Ships.json**
  * Command to import the database --> **mongoimport --db Video --collection movies --file Ships.json**
  
All our databases will be stored locally on the host system

### Connecting to DB via shell

Command to connect to localhost --> **mongo --host localhost:27017**

To check if you are connected or not, run **"show dbs"** command to see all the databases

### Connecting to DB via Compass

Once you open Compass, by default it will show to connect to localhost. So just click on the connect button and you should be connected to all the local databases, which can be seen on the left hand side panel.
You should be able to see the below databases

* 100YWeatherSmall
* Video
* Ships
* admin
* config
* local

### Writing basic queries( using shell & compass)

1. Determine the value type of elevation field for documents in the 100YWeatherSmall.datacollection?

2. What is the value type of the airTemperature field for documents in the 100YWeatherSmall.data collection?

3. How many movies in the video collection are directed by "Ã¨mile Reynaud"?

4. Write a query to get the number of movies in the video collection whose viewer rating is greater than 8?


#### Geospatial queries

This we will see in a connected DB since third party mapping services such as Mapbox are not available in Compass Isolated Edition.
